# FoxSEE Chess Engine ðŸ¦Š
A tiny yet strong chess engine written in Rust!  

- Only 3000 lines of code (excluding tests)
- Very small memory footprint (less than 3MB)

**Current Version**  
0.2.4

![alt text](https://travis-ci.org/redsalmon91/FoxSEE.svg?branch=master)

## Main Features

- 0x88 Board Representation
- Minimax Search with Alpha-Beta Pruning
- Aspiration Window
- History Heuristic
- Refutation Table
- Quiescence Search
- SEE
- MVV-LVA
- Piece-square Evaluation Table
- UCI-compatible (only the part needed for CCRL testing/competition)

## Other Features

- Extend search depth when in-check, limit to `extension_count * 2 < ply`.
- Reduce search depth for non-cap moves, test with zero window, and re-search if it fails high.
- Use `-non_captured_move_count` when one side has `score > advantage score` to encourage exchange & pawn moves when one side is in advantage & to avoid repeated moves.
- Re-captures are priorited
- `root_search` tracks history score from previous iteration to achieve better move ordering

## How to build
Run `cargo build --release`
